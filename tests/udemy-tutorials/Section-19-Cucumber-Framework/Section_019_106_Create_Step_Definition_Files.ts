==================================================
           About Step Definition Files
==================================================

Step definition files are the JavaScript files where you implement the actual code that executes each Gherkin step.
Essentially, the step definitions "glue" the plain-language steps to your test automation code.

Important Notes:
1. The step definitions receive the step text as a parameter and the implementation matches the text.
2. You typically have some kind of "World" object where Playwrightâ€™s page is instantiated and shared between steps.
3. The test runner initializes Playwright before running tests and disposes it afterward.

General Flow:
.feature file describes behavior --> step definition file implements automation --> Cucumber runs steps and outputs results.

          Creating Step Definition Files
==================================================

Cucumber has a feature that will automatically generate the basic skeleton of your steps.
