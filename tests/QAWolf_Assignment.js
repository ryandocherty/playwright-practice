/*
  In this test, I want to assert that the first 100 articles 
  on "news.ycombinator.com/newest" are sorted by newest to oldest.

  The website has timestamps in the CSS for each article.
  Every timestamp has a Class ".a", and an atrribute called "title".
  The "title" attribute is what holds the actual raw timestamp (as a string).

  My approach:
  1. Load the website to show the latest articles (only shows 30 articles at a time).
  2. Grab the time-stamps ("title" attributes) for these first 30 articles.
  3. Push these time-stamps to an array called "timeStamps".
  4. While pushing the time-stamps, check for duplicates and that there are no more than 100 items.
  5. Click the "Next" link to display the next 30 atricles.
  6. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until the "timeStamps" array contains 100 items.
  8. Create a new array called "sortedTimeStamps".
  9. Add the contents of "timeStamps" to the new array, while also sorting the items (time-stamps) from newest to oldest.
  10. Compare each element sequentially in "timeStamps" to "sortedTimeStamps".
  11. Output the appropriate message depending on the outcome.
